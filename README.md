# Analyzing Star Wars Movie Scripts

With the movie Solo: A Star Wars Story out in theaters, I wanted to do a quick analysis of the Star Wars movie scripts--notably, the original Trilogy Episodes (IV, V, and VI). The files used for the analysis can are avaliable [here](https://github.com/gastonstat/StarWars/tree/master/Text_files). One question we would like to answer is if the rebels have a boarder range of words compared to the Imperials. 

The notebook can be read [here](https://github.com/TG20/star-wars-analysis-/blob/master/starwars.ipynb).
